An application which lets you to make graph and table of achievements from any Steam profile(as long as profile is not private or friends-only). It also allows for browsing multiplayer games servers available from Steam server browser.

 2) Enter your own Steam API key(it can be requested and copied from https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
 3) Choose preferred output by clicking on radio button(table or chart).
 4) Press on Update button and wait for Steam API requests to complete(each one usually takes 1 second depending on your network and Steam servers). 
 5) Export Steam API data at the end if you want by pressing centre button. The data will be exported to JSON file in main folder, named after Steam64 ID and will contain dates and amount of achievements a user got on a specific date. Example of the output:
