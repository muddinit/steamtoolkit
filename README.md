# Steam Tool Kit 

# Description 

A application which lets you to make graph of achievements in Steam.
I plan to add more features such as server browser and inventory browser later on as I learn Node.js programming :p.

You need your own Steam API key and Steam64 ID of your specified profile.
Private/Friends only profiles won't work.
You can save chart as image and export the data requested in JSON format.

# TODO
-Reorganize and separate code.
-Add server browser(Already have it programmed, just need to adapt for this app and fix bugs).
-Reduce size of releases.
